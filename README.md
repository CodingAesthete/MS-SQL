Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern technology, making them an integral part of almost any application. The intensive database basics course will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course pays serious attention to the relational model, modeling data with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, connections, aggregation, grouping, change, delete and insert). Fundamental knowledge of ACID transactions and transaction processing is provided, as well as practical tips for tuning performance. This course lays the foundations for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts such as turning a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
